# Intro to Node.js
(5 min) What is the point of Node.js?

- Node.js is a JS runtime, but does not have access to the browser, window, DOM or anything client-facing
- Node.js is on the server, has access to file system, networking (think terminal command environment)
- Creator Ryan Dahl forked Chrome V8 (watch him present [Node.js circa 2009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_B4LTHi3I#t=3m43s))
- Other server languages: Python(1991), Java/PHP/Ruby(1995), C#(2000), Go(2009), Rust(2010)
- Ask ChatGPT: What popular companies use node.js?
- Ask ChatGPT: What software products use node.js?

Node is just ONE of many ways to achieve results.  We'll use node for how popular it is.

# Installing Node.js and setting up a project
(20 mins)  Create a new Node.js project

- Download/Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (i.e. or )
   - note: can also install via [nvm](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)
   - LTS = Long Term Support (even numbers üëç; odd numbers üëé)
   - `node -v` `npm -v`
   - [SEMVER](https://devhints.io/semver)
- Set up environment in VS Code, Prettier, ES Lint, npm intellisense, path intellisense, GitLens, Bracket Pair Colorizer
- Browser > Network tab > Disable cache
- Create a Node.js project

<!--
- console.log(global)

# Hello World
(20 mins)  Create a "Hello World" response

- Create a basic Node.js script
- Challenge: console.log('Hello World') to the terminal
- Challenge: Server respond with `<h1>Hello World</h1>`/JSON (test response with browser)

```js
import http from 'http';
  
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
  res.write('<h1>hello world</h1>');
  res.end();
});

server.listen(3030)
```

<!--
- res.statusCode = 201;
- res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
- res.write(JSON.stringify(person));
- Inspect Network tab

# Network and HTTP basics
(30 min) 

- [Network Model](https://www.9tut.com/images/ccna_self_study/TCP_UDP/TCP_UDP.jpg)
- HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
   - set of rules servers use to transfer web docs
   - stateless protocol: each request is unique and has no memory of previous requests
   - to fix: http allows sessions / cookies (thus http while stateless is not sessionless)
- HTTP Headers (metadata) are sent with every request/response and sometimes includes:
   - what type of client sent the request
   - server config
   - time/date of response
   - how long should content be stored on client
   - what format data is in
   - cookies used to track sessions
- HTTP works on request/response pairs where every request is initiated with an HTTP methods:
   - REQUEST initiated with: 
      - `GET` - get the specified resource if available; may need auth header
      - `POST` - create a new resource and add it to collection
      - `DELETE` 
   - RESPONSE returns [status code](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes): 
      - 200 OK
      - 404 File not found
      - 500 server error
- Terminology:
   - Browser: app used to access/navigate HTML docs
   - User Agent: app acting on behalf of user (ex: browser, middleware, Google service)
   - TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
   - IP: Internet Protocol
   - URL : Universal Resource Locator
   - DNS: URLs are human readable addresses stored in Domain Name Servers
   - Server: computer on internet that usually runs data storage / web app
   - Proxy: s/w or h/w acting as middle person between client/server (hide IP address)
   - Cache: way to store data on client/server to speed up perf (ex: CSS may be cached)
   - Cookie: small string of data passed back/forth between client/server to create stateful session
- URL structure
   - Protocol vs URN (Universal Resource Name)
   - URN
      - Host
      - port (usually hidden)
      - resource path (usually file location within server; looks for index.html by default)
      - URL query (`?` separates path from query; uses `&` to connect multiple key/value pairs)
- Query string parameters
- Request headers
- Cookies

# Github
(10 mins) Practice pushing commit to GH repo

- Git is not GitHub
- Why is GitHub important?
- Other options: GitLab, BitBucket
- Challenge: commit your code, create Github repo and push your commit

# Command Line Basics
(30 min) Utilize the command line

- What is the command line?  Why is it important to learn how to use it?
- `ls` `cd` `pwd` `mkdir` `cp` `mv` `rm` `touch` `man` `cat` `more` `echo` `grep`
- flags, bash
- operators: `>` `|` `*` `&&`
- Can open applications like VS Code via `vi` or `vim`, `nano`, `code .`
- Challenge: Using only terminal commands:
   - create a new desktop folder called `test`
   - within that folder create a new file called `test.txt` that has the sentence `"Hello World"`
   - create another new file called `README.md` that has a heading and a sentence with a link to google
- `ping` `traceroute` `curl` `wget` `telnet`

<!--
- Show telnet connecting to Live Server
- GET / HTTP/1.1 OR GET /data.js HTTP/1.1
- host:localhost
-->

# Modules & npm
(20 mins) 

- Encapsulation: recall how objects can encapsulate data and functions
- What is `npm`? 
   - [see npmjs.com](npmjs.com)
   - See [npm left-pad incident that broke the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_left-pad_incident)
- How to `npm i`, `node_modules` folder, `package.lock` file, `npm uninstall`
- How to import vs export (commonjs uses require; ES6 uses import)


<!--
- Browser: <script type="module" src="./module.js"></script>
- Node: import { sayHello } from './module.js'; sayHello() 
- package.json: "type": "module",
